#+DESCRIPTION: a no-fluff tree-walking toy scheme

This crate implements an interpreter for a scheme-like language using
only the Rust std library.

It is a tree-walking interpreter, and as such not suited for
performance-critical environments. The syntax and implementation are
as terse as possible.
